# Folder structure

This   'root'  contains   the  source   code  for   included
poly-fills.  But  it's  the  AST of  each  feature  that  is
included in the transpiler. These are  stored in  the folder
/AST.


### Important

**If changes would  made to a poly-fill, the  AST (an object
stored in the /AST folder) also must be updated.**
