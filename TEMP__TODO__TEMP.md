# TODO

```
------------------     MVP     ------------------

- fix test problem

- add lint

- add EVIL tests (break the code!) Mental note: as of now, I think that
  the use of polyfills would produce duplicates? CHECK!!!

- add class definition & coditional ternary operator

- clean up the code (especially in the transpiler === the web solution is
  not that important)

- NPM publish

- add COPYRIGHT LICENCE to text folder (because it's a school essay) and make
  sure to state somewhere the diff against the main LICENCE (that
  Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 only is effectual for the source code)

- make sure everything works out just fine live

- WRITE, WRITE, WRITE

-------------------------------------------------

-----------------     EXTRA     -----------------

- add promises

- better responsivity (IMPORTANT!)

- clean up web solution

- drag and drop in the AST-view (AST EDITOR!!!) OR... form input attached to
  every field (would be a REALLY cool effect)

- better writing

- npm link (archaize cli)

- more features in the transpiler (more than promises)

- more sophisticated tests

-------------------------------------------------

----------------     GENERAL     ----------------

- VERY important to stress the writing (blog!)

- Find ways to circumscribe the fact it's an essay

- Include screenshots in text
