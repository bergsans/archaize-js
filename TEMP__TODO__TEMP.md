# TODO

```
------------------     MVP     ------------------

- fix test problem

- add lint

- add EVIL tests (break the code!) Mental note: as of now, I think that
  the use of polyfills would produce duplicates? CHECK!!!

- add class definition & coditional ternary operator

- clean up the code (especially in the transpiler === the web solution is
  not that important)

- NPM publish

- add COPYRIGHT LICENCE to text folder (because it's a school essay) and make
  sure to state somewhere the diff against the main LICENCE (that
  Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 only is effectual for the source code)

- make sure everything works out just fine live

- add index.js for NPM package (export makeAST and transpile)

- WRITE, WRITE, WRITE

-------------------------------------------------

-----------------     EXTRA     -----------------

**GRADING OF IMPORTANCE:** 1-3 (1 === less important, 3 === more important)

- add promises                                         : 2

- better responsivity (IMPORTANT!)                     : 3

- clean up web solution                                : 2

- drag and drop in the AST-view (AST EDITOR!!!)        : 1
  OR... form input attached to
  every field (would be a REALLY cool effect)

- better writing                                       : 3

- npm link (archaize cli)                              : 3

- more features in the transpiler                      : 1
  (more than promises)  

- more sophisticated tests                             : 2

-------------------------------------------------

----------------     GENERAL     ----------------

- VERY important to stress the writing (blog!)

- Find ways to circumscribe the fact it's an essay

- Include screenshots in text
