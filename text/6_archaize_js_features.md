# Archaize JS Features

The following chapter will contain a number of sections with an 
identical structure. Each section will first provide the background of 
a feature. It will describe what the feature does, how it works and 
give some code examples. With this background at hand, the problem in 
the context of a transpiler - more specifically, in the context of 
Archaize JS - will have some room. In most cases, I won't describe 
any solutions or reflect on the problems attached on a deeper level.

Sections will topic each feature, excluding the polyfills that will be 
gathered, clumped together under one umbrella.
