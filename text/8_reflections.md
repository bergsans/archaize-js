# Reflections


## Concluding remarks
To learn about and construct a transpiler is an adventure. You don't 
only gain general knowledge on how (in the context of web front-end 
development) transpilers like TypeScript, Babel.js, ESLint (or CoffeeScript, 
ClojureScript, Elixir, ReasonML ...) works 'under the hood'; you also 
gain 'power' over the same process. Even if you won't develop anything 
as complex as Babel.js or TypeScript, you learn to use a very powerful 
instrument that can perform all sorts of tasks. Transpilers are everywhere.

My next step is to learn more about other parts of this process than working 
with the Abstract Syntax Tree, even though this is the mest - as of my 
knowledge - the most crucial step in a transpiler; it's here where the 
magic takes place. I also one day want to build my own (limited) compiler.

To me, it would seem quite 'instrumental' to speculate on how this would 'develop' you 
as a programmer. My guess though is that building a compiler or the whole 
process of a transpiler offer no short-term gains; however, it would 
seem reasonable to argue that the long-term effects on your skill set 
are enormous. I bet the same thing could be said about algorithms and 
data structures. 

Perhaps all the things mentioned could be compared with the discussion on 
the uses of the humanities? Unfortunately, this age seems to emphasize 'concrete' 
skills and disfavor 'general' abilities. But I'm very skeptical that it would 
be possible to be a good programmer without a general understanding of 
these matters. If you can't produce 'distance' to code, how would you be 
able to reason about it and make intelligent choices regarding the overall 
architecture? My guess is that this also would be true for the details.

Even though I think the reflections in the passage above are important, I've been 
fortunate enough to grow very fond of compilers/transpilers. Also, I think 
that transpilers (especially understanding Abstract Syntax Trees and be able to 
manipulate them) are very useful, even to a junior developer. Ok, I know this 
can be included in, for instance, ESLint but you have the ability to 
write 'logic' that identifies console logs, warns about un-used variables 
and so on. Depending on your project, you could tailor this and make 
the 'search and replace'-pattern specific to your project. Not bad.
