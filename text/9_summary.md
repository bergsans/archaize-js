# Summary
<pre>
Archaize JS is  an exploration on how  transpilers work. The
aim  is  to answer  this  in  theory,  but mainly  by  code.
Archaize can transpile most of the main functionality of ES6
to  ES5.  It also  covers,  in  very  general terms,  how  a
transpiler  works in  theory. It's  main shortcoming  is not
describing this process in detail, especially concerning how
Archaize JS  manages different  problems. On the  other hand
that would have a required a longer text, perhaps even book.

The main  focus of  the Archaize  JS is  to handle  the data
transformations of  the Abstract  Syntax Tree.  The finished
product includes these parts:

* ...a ES6 to ES5 transpiler (main part)
    * Feature list include the core of ES6
    * Theory. How a transpiler works and why they are important 
* ...a NPM package
* ...a CLI to transpile JavaScript files
* ...a Minimalistic Web Solution 
    * Front-end (React)
    * Back-end (Node.js, Express & Socket.io)
