# Analysis
<pre>
The  big  question I  stated  in  the first  chapter  really
doesn't get an  answer in this text. I  need more experience
and gain a deeper understanding of  the process at work in a
compiler  or  transpiler,  to  explain  everything  in  more
detail.

The main question  of this essay is how  the Abstract Syntax
Tree  of  a  transpiler  works.  I  have  partly  implicitly
answered this in chapter six, but also by use of programming
(code, that is).  However, the sections of  chapter sex have
had the  character of  being notes. They  focus on  the main
'problem' at hand  and present the feature and  how it could
be used.  By doing  this the  reader gets a  clue on  how to
actually solve the problem  of transpiling that feature from
ES6 to  ES5. In this  chapter, I will shortly  say something
about that process.
